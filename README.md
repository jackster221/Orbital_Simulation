# Orbital_Simulation

Orbital_Simulation is a Unity-based project that uses principles of physics and orbital mechanics to create an interactive simulation of celestial bodies and their motion in space. The simulation represents the motion of planets, satellites, and other celestial bodies in 3D space.

## Features

The Orbital_Simulation project currently offers the following features:

1. **Celestial Body Motion**: Realistic simulation of celestial bodies including their orbital paths and velocities.
2. **Interactivity**: User can pause, resume, and reset the simulation to observe different aspects of the celestial body movements.
3. **Information Display**: On hovering over a celestial body, an information panel displays relevant details such as name and mass of the celestial body.
4. **Projection Paths**: The program shows the projected path of each celestial body, giving a glimpse into the future of their motion.
5. **Scalable Distance**: The view of the information panel scales depending on the distance of the celestial body from the camera.

## Running the Simulation

To run the Orbital_Simulation project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity. You should have Unity installed on your machine (version XXX or above). If you don't have Unity installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://unity.com/).
3. In the Unity editor, navigate to the Scene you wish to run.
4. Press the play button at the top of the Unity editor to start the simulation.

Enjoy exploring the universe!

## Future Work

Future versions of this simulation aim to add features such as user-controlled spacecraft, interaction with celestial bodies, and more.
