# Orbital_Simulation

Orbital_Simulation is a Unity-based project that uses principles of physics and orbital mechanics to create an interactive simulation of celestial bodies and their motion in space. The simulation represents the motion of planets, satellites, and other celestial bodies in 3D space.

Development still in progress
